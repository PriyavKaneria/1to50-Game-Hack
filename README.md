## Average time of solve : 2.05 s

## Working
The code simply takes a screenshot of the screen area twice. Once initially and once when the first 25 are clicked.
The screenshot is processed, tiled to 25 images, recombined with a buffer for high accuracy and then sent for OCR using tesseract.
The output list is mapped for the position of each number and mouse is moved and clicked.
